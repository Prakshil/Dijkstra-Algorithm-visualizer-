# Shortest Path Finder – Dijkstra Visualizer with Map 🌐

This project is an interactive web app for visualizing **Dijkstra's algorithm**. You can build and edit your own graphs, watch the algorithm in action, and even find real-world shortest routes on a map!  
Perfect for students, educators, or anyone curious about how shortest path algorithms work.

## 🚀 Features

- **Graph Visualizer:**  
  - Add, move, and connect nodes to build custom graphs.
  - Set edge weights and see them displayed.
  - Switch between Edit and Select modes.
  - Visualize Dijkstra’s algorithm step-by-step.
  - Adjustable animation speed.
  - Sample graph and clear/reset options.

- **Map Mode:**  
  - Place start and end points on a real-world map.
  - Choose transport mode: Driving, Walking, or Cycling.
  - Calculate and display the shortest route using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
  - See distance and estimated time.
  - Clear markers, reset, and locate your current position.

- **Instructions Tab:**  
  - Easy-to-follow usage guide.
  - Brief explanation of Dijkstra’s algorithm and visualization legend.

## 📚 About Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. It's widely used in navigation and routing systems.
